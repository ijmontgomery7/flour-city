        <div class="mat-body">
          The History of Rochester begins with the history of the Genesee Valley.
          Originally inhabited Seneca Tribe of Native Americans. In 1789 the first mill was constructed a deal
          for land was made with the Seneca tribe in exchange for mill usage.
          The geography of the area lent a hand to its growth, fertile lands surround the Genesee, while the
          river itself has powerful waterfalls. These waterfalls would attract the attention of Col. Nathan Rochester
          who saw more potential for the Genesee Valley. The Rochester and the Brown families would combine
          their efforts in 1811 and founded the town that would go on to be Rochester. The newly created Rochesterville
          (the -ville was dropped soon after) housed a
          population of 700 people. The areas powerful falls and easy connection to Lake Ontario made shipping
          products easier because the mills close location to areas suitable to dock ships and rafts.

        The canal completed in 1825 was easily the largest public works project of the young United States.
        Its 350 miles of waterways allowed the canal barges to ship goods east-west at fraction of its former prices.
        The plans for the canal involved a stone aqueduct which carried the canal though the heart of Rochester
        and across the Genesee river. Rochester would become a central trading spot for years to come.
        Before the canal the transport from Albany to Buffalo went for $60 per ton and after the canal
        it was reduced to $10. This allowed for the Rochester flour mills to have larger radius of place
        they could cost effectively ship to. By 1826 only one year after the canal was build the mills were
        shipping 202,000 barrels of flour in a year. Flour account for 800,000 dollars of canal exports from
        Rochester 2/3rds of the total value of the cityâ€™s exports.
